## Abstract

This tutorial is aimed at new users, who have some minor knowledge of Pascal and general concepts of programming and game development. It will cover all steps necessary from creation and setting up of the project, to a small but finished game.

Required level of Pascal knowledge: Low.

Required level of Castle Game Engine knowledge: Zero.

Expected duration: 3-4 hours.

## Goal of this tutorial

(In this tutorial we'll learn how to)

(Simple introduction at the beginning with game rules, screenshot, download button)

You can download the compiled version of the game at https://decoherence.itch.io/button-clicker-game (Windows, Linux, Android).

## Set up the Environment

For this tutorial we shall be using Lazarus IDE. We shan't use GUI provided by Lazarus, therefore this is not a requirement, just a personal preference. The tutorial can be easily followed using any other IDE or even a text editor capable of editing FreePascal code.

Before we start:

* Make sure that Lazarus + FPC are properly installed.

* Make sure Castle Game Engine packages are installed, compiled and working properly. We shall be using `castle_base.lpk` and `castle_window.lpk` packages.

* Make sure that `alternative_castle_window_based_on_lcl.lpk` is _**NOT**_ installed in Lazarus, as it will conflict with `castle_window.lpk` package we shall be using.

* Make sure the required libraries are installed in the system or available on system $PATH. Try compiling a few examples from `examples` folder to make sure they're working.

* Make sure system environment variables required for Castle Game Engine and Castle Editor are set up properly.

* Make sure Castle Editor, set up properly, is compiled and ready to use.

## Creating an Empty Project

### Creating a Project in Castle Editor

Run Castle Editor and select "New Project":

It will open "New Project" dialogue, which will ask us to select template, name and folder for the project:

In this tutorial we'll be using the most basic template - "Empty".

Next, let's write a name for the project "ButtonClickerGame". Note that the name cannot start with a number. And it's best to avoid non-ASCII characters or spaces in project name or path. Also it's a good idea to limit the path to the project to 255 symbols, which might cause bugs on some exotic platforms.

The filled-in form should look something like that:

All that's left to do is to press "Create Project" button. This will create a simple dummy project we can start filling with our game-specific code and assets.

### What's inside?

Let's open freshly created `ButtonClickerGame_standalone.lpi` in Lazarus. We can immediately compile and run it (by selecting Run -> Run menu or by pressing "F9" on the keyboard).

As it is a template, it's a fully functional minimalistic project, that will show us an empty dark gray window with a lone FPS counter:

No, Empty project is not actually empty, but it contains:

* `code` folder where the code of the project is stred. We shall also store our own units in this folder.

- `code/gameinitialize.pas` - pascal unit for initialization of the game.

- `code/gamestatemain.pas` - pascal unit for Main State of the User Interface. It describes how this State should work.

* `data` folder where the data for our project is located. We shall be adding our game data inside there as we go.

- `CastleSettings.xml` - settings of our game project, can be edited with any text editor like notepad.

- `state_main.castle-user-interface` - design of the Main State. We can edit it with Castle Editor.

- `README.txt` - short reminder of what the `data` folder is and where to get additional information. We don't need this file and it can be deleted right away.

* `.gitignore` a gitignore file that gives us a ready-to-use list of ignored files when using GIT version control system. It's already fine-tuned to include all autogenerated and temporary files that are created during the game compilation. If we already compiled the game, there will be additional files in our folder (e.g. `ButtonClickerGame.exe`) that are ignored by GIT clients, and also not listed in the current list.

* `ButtonClickerGame_standalone.lpi` - Lazarus/FreePascal project information. It contains settings and parameters for our project, already fine-tuned to use with Castle Game Engine.

* `ButtonClickerGame_standalone.lpr` - Lazarus project file - an autogenerated file that enables convenient working with our project from Lazarus. It can be opened it in Lazarus or any text editor. `lpr` stands for "Lazarus project" but in everything else it's equal to a normal `pas` file.

* `castleautogenerated.pas` - a Pascal unit with automatically generated additional information about the project.

* `CastleEngineManifest.xml` - a Castle Game Engine manifest file, that describes some important settings for the project that control how the project is compiled, packaged and distributed.

* `README.md` - a short readme file for our project - or rather a place to get us started writing our own.
