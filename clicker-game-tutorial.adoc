## Abstract

This tutorial is aimed at new users, who have some minor knowledge of Pascal and general concepts of programming and game development. It will cover all steps necessary from creation and setting up of the project, to a small but finished game.

Required level of Pascal knowledge: Low.

Required level of Castle Game Engine knowledge: Zero.

Expected duration: 3-4 hours.

## Goal of this tutorial

(In this tutorial we'll learn how to)

(Simple introduction at the beginning with game rules, screenshot, download button)

You can download the compiled version of the game at https://decoherence.itch.io/button-clicker-game (Windows, Linux, Android).

## Set up the Environment

For this tutorial we shall be using Lazarus IDE. We shan't use GUI provided by Lazarus, therefore this is not a requirement, just a personal preference. The tutorial can be easily followed using any other IDE or even a text editor capable of editing FreePascal code.

Before we start:

* Make sure that Lazarus + FPC are properly installed.

* Make sure Castle Game Engine packages are installed, compiled and working properly. We shall be using `castle_base.lpk` and `castle_window.lpk` packages.

* Make sure that `alternative_castle_window_based_on_lcl.lpk` is _**NOT**_ installed in Lazarus, as it will conflict with `castle_window.lpk` package we shall be using.

* Make sure the required libraries are installed in the system or available on system $PATH. Try compiling a few examples from `examples` folder to make sure they're working.

* Make sure system environment variables required for Castle Game Engine and Castle Editor are set up properly.

* Make sure Castle Editor, set up properly, is compiled and ready to use.

## Creating an Empty Project

Run Castle Editor and select "New Project":

It will open "New Project" dialogue, which will ask us to select template, name and folder for the project:
