# castle-editor-tutorial

## Abstract

A Castle Editor tutorial, that shows how to create and use Castle User Interface.

## Set up environment

For this tutorial we shall be using Lazarus IDE. We shan't use GUI provided by Lazarus, therefore this is not a requirement, just a personal preference. You can easily follow this tutorial in any other IDE capable of editing FreePascal code.

Before we start:

* Make sure that Lazarus + FPC are properly installed.

* Make sure Castle Game Engine packages are installed, compiled and working properly (try compiling a few examples from `examples` folder to make sure they're working). We shall be using `castle_base.lpk` and `castle_window.lpk` packages. Make sure that `alternative_castle_window_based_on_lcl.lpk` is _**NOT**_ installed in Lazarus, as it will conflict with window package we shall be using.

* Make sure system environment variables required for Castle Game Engine are set up properly.

* Make sure Castle Editor is compiled and ready to use.
