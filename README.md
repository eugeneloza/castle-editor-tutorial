## Abstract

A Castle Editor tutorial, that shows how to create and use Castle User Interface.

## Set up environment

For this tutorial we shall be using Lazarus IDE. We shan't use GUI provided by Lazarus, therefore this is not a requirement, just a personal preference. You can easily follow this tutorial in any other IDE capable of editing FreePascal code.

Before we start, make sure that Lazarus + FPC are properly installed and Castle Game Engine (CGE) is installed, compiled and working properly (try compiling a few examples from `examples` folder to make sure they're working. Make sure Castle Editor is compiled and ready to use.
