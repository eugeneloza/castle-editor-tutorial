# BUTTON CLICKER GAME

A clicker game requiring speed, accuracy and concentration.

This game was created as a tutorial for Castle Game Engine (https://castle-engine.io/). The tutorial text and source code will be available in several days.

## About the game

In this game you have to click the buttons on screen.

Each button has a growing score - clicking the button adds this score to your total score.

However, if the button grows to score 999 - it's Game Over!

Each button starts without a score - avoid clicking such buttons, as it will increase the game pace.

Get as many points as you can and earn achievements!

Good luck and have fun!
